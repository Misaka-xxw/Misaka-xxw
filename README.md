## Hi there 👋

Thank you for visiting my Github page!
I am Misaka-xxw, a junior student majoring in Computer Science and Technology from China.
My Chinese nickname is 昔我往矣, you can call me 小昔 or 小w. ✨

### 🌱 I’m currently learning (or rather, what I want to learn)

+ C/C++/C#/Python/Java and other foundational programming languages
+ Unity 2D game development
+ Vue and JavaScript
+ Fundamentals of computer science
+ Embedded systems

### 💬 My personal blogs

+ [cnblog](https://home.cnblogs.com/u/3404836)
+ [hexo blog](https://misaka-xxw.github.io/)
+ As you can see, I haven't updated them yet. But I will update them in the future.

### 📜 Some of my ideas

+ To create several Unity 2D games, both individually and as a team.
+ To develop practical utility software for computers or mobile phones, designed to address the specific needs and lifestyle of college students, perhaps?
+ To make small toys with microcontrollers, perhaps?

### 📫 How to reach me

Well, I don't have a reliable personal email at the moment.
If you know my QQ account, you can send me a message on QQ.
If you know my Bilibili account, you can send me a private message.
If you don't know either, just leave an issue on Github.
